# Flashcards for Data Fundamentals (H) 
Flashcards for the DF(H) course at UofG. These can be imported into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to use as a study aid using spaced repetition.

Anki runs on desktop platforms, and (as a paid version) on Android and iOS. If there are other spaced repetition software formats that would be useful, please open an issue.

The flash cards are divided into one deck per unit.

## Pull requests
If you want to add or modify the cards, please make a PR and I'll merge it.
