scatter plot; a type of plot where individual data points are represented as dots on a two-dimensional plane, useful for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables
line plot; a plot where data points are connected by straight lines, emphasizing the trend or pattern in the data over a continuous range, suitable for time-series or sequential data where data lies on a true continuum
staircase plot; a type of plot where data points are connected by horizontal and vertical lines, creating a step-like appearance, often used to represent discrete or categorical data
bar chart; a graphical representation of categorical data using rectangular bars of varying heights or lengths, with the length of each bar proportional to the value it represents, suitable for comparing discrete categories
Box plot; a statistical plot that displays the distribution of a dataset, indicating the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values, providing insights into the data's spread and identifying potential outliers
polar coord; a coordinate system where data points are plotted on a circular grid, often used to display cyclical or periodic data
log-log coord; a coordinate system where both x-axis and y-axis have logarithmic scales, useful for visualizing data with exponential growth or decay
semilog coord; a coordinate system where only one axis (either x or y) has a logarithmic scale, suitable for data with a wide range of values
symlog coord; a coordinate system where linear scaling is used for small values, and logarithmic scaling is used for large values, accommodating data with both small and large magnitude
aspect ratio; the ratio of the plot's width to its height, influencing the visual perception of the data, where equal aspect ratios maintain proportionality in the plot elements
figure size; the dimensions (width and height) of the entire plotting area, determining the overall size of the plot and its readability, important for adjusting the plot to fit within documents or presentations
histogram; a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset, showing the frequency of different ranges of values
Box plot; a graphical summary of a dataset's distribution, displaying the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values, useful for detecting outliers
violin plot; a combination of a Box plot and a density plot, providing a more detailed view of the data's distribution, especially in terms of skewness and multimodality
dot plot; a simple chart where each data point is represented by a dot along a single axis, useful for comparing individual values in a dataset
means; the arithmetic average of a set of values, calculated by adding up all values and dividing by the total number of values
medians; the middle value in a sorted dataset, separating the higher half from the lower half of the data points
error bars; graphical representations of the variability or uncertainty of data points in a plot, typically indicating the standard deviation or confidence intervals
confidence intervals; a range of values that is likely to contain an unknown population parameter, providing a measure of the uncertainty associated with a sample estimate
standard deviation; a measure of the dispersion or spread of a set of values, indicating how much the values deviate from the mean
standard error; an estimate of the standard deviation of a sample population, indicating the variability of the sample mean
uncertainty representation; the visual depiction of the degree of confidence or reliability associated with data points or statistical estimates in a plot
